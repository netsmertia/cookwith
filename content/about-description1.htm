<p>I love nothing more&nbsp;than sharing a meal with my family. I couldn’t help posting a&nbsp;snapshot of my adorable grandchildren who&nbsp;always&nbsp;enjoy&nbsp;my favourite recipes.</p>
<p>I hope the passion I have for making people happy, through my dishes, is something I can continue to share with all of you.&nbsp;Since I’ve been cooking, my recipes have travelled the world and my plastic containers have crossed continents, simply to put smiles on hundreds of hungry faces.</p>
<p>To some people, it was a priceless taste of a home they missed, to others, a surprising brand-new experience, but my&nbsp;vision for Cook with Sousou has always been just to share my love for cooking with as many people as I can.</p>
