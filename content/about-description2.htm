<p>Although my culinary journey started in Lebanon, my recipes are also inspired by my time living and cooking in Cyprus. I regularly shared my love for cooking with my friends from all over the world in Armenia, Greece, Morocco, Cyprus, Syria, Iraq, France and India and in return they shared with me their favourite ingredients, hints and tips and different cooking methods which have been woven together to create a truly diverse collection of sensational recipes.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoy browsing through and trying some of the recipes I’ve included here. I love learning and trying new recipes, so if there’s something you’d like me to try out send me a message here and I’ll give it a go.</p>
